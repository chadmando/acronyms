# acronyms
 
 A collection of acronyms from business, technology, security, and engineering.
 I am documenting the acronyms that I encounter while working, studying, and researching.

 ## Scope

 Reminders on what not to include:
 1. No common government agencies (e.g. IRS, FBI, CIA, etc.)
 1. No common acronyms that have become integrated into modern language (e.g. SCUBA, PIN, etc.) 
 
 ## Future Plans

 I _might_ use this data to create an API.
